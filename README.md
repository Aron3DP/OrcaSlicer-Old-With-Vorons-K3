These folders are in your AppData folder OrcaSlicer
%AppData%\Roaming\OrcaSlicer\user

From there is you don't sign in they will be placed in the "default" folder. If you do sign in you will see another folder that is just numbers and you would place them in there. This folder syncs with the Cloud as well.

For the custom profiles do be visible you do have to add the Premade Preset for Bambu X1C, Bambu P1P, and I added a Voron 0.1.
